This program uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to find the location of someoneâ€™s hand, and then translate the Viewport within a 3D design Software accordingly. (Assuming Middle Mouse Button is used to translate). The model is trained using a dataset specific to my room, this means it likely will not work for everyone, I would liked to have gotten more training images but I am restricted due to Covid. I have provided the required helper programs to create your own dataset and train a model specific to your use case.
